`/transit` for a snapshot at a specific moment (\"What's happening now?\")\n\n**Perfect for:**\n- 📅 Monthly/yearly transit forecasts\n- 🔔 Transit notification and calendar apps\n- 🎯 Planning important events around favorable transits\n- 📊 Long-term astrological planning\n\n**What you get:**\n- **All transits in the period** with dates when aspects form\n- **Exact timing** (`exact_time`) — precise moment when aspect perfects (0° orb)\n- **Aspect direction** — `applying` (forming), `separating` (dissolving), or `exact`\n- **Transit speed** — planetary velocity (negative = retrograde)\n- **Orb measurements** — angular distance from perfection\n- **Period statistics** — total transits, major transits, exact aspects count\n\n**Analysis includes:**\n- **Major life transits** (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto)\n- **Personal daily transits** (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars)\n- **Nodal transits** for karmic timing and life direction\n- **Angular transits** to Ascendant, Midheaven for major life themes\n\n**Technical features:**\n- **Aspect direction**: `applying` (forming), `separating` (dissolving), or `exact`\n- **Exact timing**: ISO datetime when aspect perfects (for close
